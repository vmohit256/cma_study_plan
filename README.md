# Study Plan

* Rank order the 8 papers. Put more fundamental / easier papers at the top. Example ordering: CEL, SFM, DIT, SCM, CMAD, CFR, ITLP, SPMBV
* Master each paper sequentially. Move to the next one only after getting >= 80% marks on past Official Model Question Papers for that paper
* Within a paper, master each section sequentially. And within a section, master each module sequentially.

There are total 25 sections.

CEL (2) + SFM (5) + DIT (2) + SCM (2) + CMAD (4) + CFR (6) + ITLP (2) + SPMBV (2) = 25

On average 2 weeks per section -> 1 year worth of prep (approx. 6 weeks per paper)

There are total

(11) + (17) + (14) + (15) + (18) + (8) + (27) + (9) = 119 modules

Roughly 2-3 modules per week. Sounds reasonable.

## Steps for mastering a module

Taking SCM - module 5 (Evaluating Performance) as an example.

### Go over the theory

* Binge through the theory in a single day. Doesn't matter if things are unclear. It only matters if the theory is roughly present in the mind
* Avoid looking at examples and illustrations while going through the theory
* After a few quick passes of the theory, solve each example / illustration one by one
    - Try to solve the example without looking at the solution
    - IMPORTANT: don't be stuck for too long! If stuck for more than 1 minute, then look at the next few lines of the solution to quickly unstuck yourself.
    - Slowly uncover the solution of the example. Taking help only if you are stuck.
* Refer to additional reading resources if the topic is too difficult to understand

There are 22 illustrations in Evaluating Performance module! If

Hopefully, these combined by additional resources cited in them for each topic should be enough for theory.

## Official Historical Papers

suggested answers: https://icmai.in/studentswebsite/exam_suggestedanswers.php

These are very important. Avoid looking at them during the prep and solve them just before taking the official exam.
